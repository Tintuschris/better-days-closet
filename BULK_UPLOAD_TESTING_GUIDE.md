# 🧪 Bulk Upload Testing Guide

## ✅ **Syntax Error Fixed!**

The JSX syntax error has been resolved. The issue was that the `Step1TemplateAndFiles` component was incomplete - it was missing the template download section, file upload sections, and closing braces.

### **What Was Fixed:**
- ✅ Completed the Step1 component with all required sections
- ✅ Added template download UI
- ✅ Added CSV and image upload sections  
- ✅ Added next button with processing state
- ✅ Proper component closure and separation
